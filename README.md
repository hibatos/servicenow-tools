Tools for the servicenow platform

## Intro

Hi there👋.  
If you are a ServiceNow dev, this might be the right place for you.  
Here I publish some of my tools that I develop in my free time on my PDI, for you to use free of charge.  
But I do not guarantee that all of them work as expected.  
So if you use them, do your own testing.  
Also for most packages I do not recommend using them on production instances.  
If you do so anyways, at least do your own research first.
